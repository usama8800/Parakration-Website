{% set prologue = "<b>Shoes of Sherlock</b>, ParaKration’s signature event, effectively merges together scientific hypothesis and print journalism. It combines the attributes of science and the written word to provide you with a chance to experience Sherlock’s sleuth and deductive methods. This particular event focuses on a hefty amount of discussions and development of ideas and the overall thought process. Language will serve as a means of expression and introduction of various contrasting theories that will eventually lead to you and your team in solving a complex case. Each member of the team may choose between their tasks – whether they want to take on the role of the detective or the journalist. " %}
